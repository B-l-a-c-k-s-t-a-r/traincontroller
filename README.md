Traincontroller is intended to expand the old way to control rail (and other) models using DCC.
It is expected to maitain, for a while at least, DCC compatibility. 
New controllers will expand the control and monitoring capabilities including:
- wifi bidirectional connection for control and feedback
- bluetooth connection for vehicle teaming
- onboard g sensor and compass to detect movement, position, direction
- NFC reader for truck localization and advanced control
- advanced sound control based on full situational awareness and control
- advanced motion control based on full situational awareness and control
